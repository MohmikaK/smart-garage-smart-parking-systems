Our smart garage system uses Raspberry Pi and ESP32 to automate and enhance convenience and security. It features motion detection with a PIR sensor to activate the garage light, an ultrasonic sensor to monitor car proximity and sound a buzzer if too close, and a servo motor to automate the garage door, which can also be remotely controlled via a mobile dashboard using Blynk. Additionally, it includes a security alert system that triggers a dashboard LED and sends an alert message when motion is detected.

Our Arduino-based smart parking system uses ultrasonic sensors to detect available parking spaces and displays the availability on an LCD screen. The LCD at the gate notifies drivers if parking is full or available, it also indicates the specific vacant spaces. LEDs assist in guiding vehicles to free spots, and a servo motor automates the parking gate. This system simplifies parking management with clear, real-time updates and efficient space utilization.
